  "overview": "Aggregates customer feedback from every channel into unified, actionable intelligence This AI Worker ensures no customer voice goes unheard. It collects feedback from support tickets, surveys, social media, reviews, sales calls, and community forums—then categorizes, analyzes sentiment, extracts themes, and prioritizes by business impact. The worker identifies emerging issues before they become crises, tracks sentiment trends over time, and surfaces specific verbatims that crystallize customer needs. Your VoC program moves from periodic reports to continuous intelligence.",
