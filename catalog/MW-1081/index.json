  "overview": "This AI Worker mines your existing talent database to surface candidates you've already paid to acquire. It searches past applicants, silver medalists, and previous employees against new requisitions, then ranks them by fit and recency. It also searches connected external sources to identify passive candidates. Every sourced candidate receives a personalized outreach sequence, and interested candidates are automatically progressed to screening.",
