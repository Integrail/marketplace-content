# How it Works: Compliance & Audit AI Worker

Maintains SOX compliance and supports internal and external audit requirements This AI Worker makes audit readiness continuous rather than seasonal. It monitors control execution across all SOX-relevant processes, collects evidence of control operation, identifies control failures before auditors do, and maintains organized documentation for audit requests. When auditors need support, it retrieves requested documentation instantly, answers standard questions, and tracks PBC list completion. Your audit becomes faster, cheaper, and lower-stress.
