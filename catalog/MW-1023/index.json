  "overview": "Continuously analyzes customer health and triggers proactive interventions This AI Worker gives you x-ray vision into account health. It monitors every signal—usage patterns, support ticket volume and sentiment, engagement frequency, billing status, NPS responses—and maintains real-time health scores that predict outcomes. When an account's health declines, it triggers automated interventions or alerts CSMs with specific concerns and recommended actions. The worker surfaces healthy accounts for expansion and identifies patterns that indicate systemic issues across your customer base.",
