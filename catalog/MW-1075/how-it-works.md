# How it Works: Client Intelligence AI Worker

Aggregates client information and prepares comprehensive briefings for meetings This AI Worker ensures every client interaction is informed and impactful. It aggregates information from across your systems—portfolio performance, recent communications, service requests, market developments relevant to their holdings, relationship history—and synthesizes it into actionable briefings. Before any client meeting, your team has complete context on the relationship, recent developments, and recommended discussion topics. Clients feel known and valued; teams feel prepared and confident.
