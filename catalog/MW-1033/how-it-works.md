# How it Works: Applicant Qualification & Ranking AI Worker

Screens all incoming applicants against job requirements and ranks by fit This AI Worker ensures no qualified candidate slips through the cracks—and no unqualified candidate wastes recruiter time. For every new applicant, it parses their resume, extracts key qualifications, matches them against job requirements, detects red flags, and applies a weighted scoring algorithm. Candidates are categorized as Strong Match, Potential Fit, Weak Match, or Unclear, with all results automatically updated in your ATS. Recruiters start each day with a prioritized queue instead of an overwhelming inbox.
