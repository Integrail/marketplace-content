# How it Works: Customer Journey Mapping AI Worker

Visualizes and optimizes customer journeys with real-time behavioral data This AI Worker replaces assumption-based journey maps with data-driven reality. It tracks actual customer behavior across touchpoints, identifies the paths successful customers take versus those who struggle, and surfaces friction points that cause drop-off or frustration. The worker enables continuous journey optimization—not annual mapping exercises—by monitoring journey health metrics and alerting teams when specific stages degrade.
