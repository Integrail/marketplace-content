# How it Works: Contract Extraction AI Worker

Parses investment agreements and creates structured, searchable contract databases This AI Worker transforms contract management from filing cabinet chaos into structured intelligence. It ingests investment agreements, partnership documents, and side letters, then extracts key terms—fee structures, waterfall provisions, reporting requirements, consent rights, transfer restrictions—into standardized fields. The worker maintains a searchable database of all contract terms, alerts you to upcoming obligations, and enables rapid analysis across the entire portfolio of agreements.
