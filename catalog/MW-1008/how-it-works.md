# How it Works: Consolidation AI Worker

Combines financial data across entities and produces consolidated statements This AI Worker eliminates the complexity of multi-entity consolidation. It collects trial balances from all entities, maps local charts of accounts to consolidated structure, performs currency translation at appropriate rates, generates intercompany eliminations, and produces fully consolidated financial statements. The worker handles minority interests, equity method investments, and complex ownership structures—delivering consolidated results in hours instead of days.
