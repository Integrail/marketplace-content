  "overview": "Models business scenarios and provides decision support for strategic planning This AI Worker enables rapid what-if analysis that would take weeks manually. It builds scenario models based on key business drivers, quantifies the financial impact of strategic alternatives, and presents results in decision-ready formats. Whether evaluating M&A targets, assessing market entry options, or stress-testing for economic downturns, the worker delivers rigorous analysis that supports better strategic decisions. Scenario planning moves from annual exercises to continuous capability.",
