# How it Works: CSAT/NPS Analysis AI Worker

Transforms satisfaction metrics into understanding of loyalty drivers This AI Worker turns satisfaction surveys from a reporting exercise into a strategic improvement tool. It analyzes open-ended responses at scale, correlates scores with customer behaviors, identifies segments with divergent satisfaction, and surfaces the specific drivers that create promoters and detractors. The worker prioritizes improvement initiatives by projected NPS impact, enabling data-driven decisions about where to invest in customer experience.
