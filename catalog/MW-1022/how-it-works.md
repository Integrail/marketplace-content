# How it Works: Expansion/Upsell AI Worker

Identifies and executes growth opportunities across your customer base This AI Worker transforms customer success from a cost center into a revenue engine. It continuously monitors usage patterns, feature adoption, and growth signals to identify expansion opportunities—additional seats, feature upgrades, cross-sell products. For each opportunity, it scores likelihood to convert, identifies the right stakeholders, and creates personalized expansion proposals with ROI justification. The worker executes outreach, handles initial objections, and hands qualified opportunities to sales or CSMs for closing.
