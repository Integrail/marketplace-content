# How it Works: Deal Flow Intelligence AI Worker

Monitors incoming opportunities and surfaces the most promising investments This AI Worker ensures you never miss a great opportunity—and never waste time on poor fits. It monitors all incoming deal flow from brokers, intermediaries, direct sourcing, and network referrals, then filters and prioritizes based on your investment criteria. The worker identifies pattern matches to successful past investments, flags potential concerns early, and routes opportunities to the right team members. Your deal team focuses on evaluation rather than triage.
