# How it Works: Fund Event Capture AI Worker

Monitors and captures fund events for timely and accurate reporting This AI Worker ensures no fund event goes unrecorded. It monitors multiple data sources—fund administrator portals, GP communications, wire activity, document deliveries—to capture capital calls, distributions, NAV updates, and other fund events in real-time. The worker reconciles events against expected schedules, flags discrepancies, and maintains complete fund activity records. Your operations team manages by exception rather than constant monitoring.
