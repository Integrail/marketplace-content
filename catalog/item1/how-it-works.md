4. For matches within your tolerance threshold, flags them as ready for approval
5. For discrepancies, creates an exception report with details and routes it to the right approver based on your rules

### What you'll get:

- Daily summary of processed invoices in Slack or email
- Exception reports with clear explanations of discrepancies
- Reduced backlog and faster payment cycles
