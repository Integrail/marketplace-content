  "overview": "Processes invoices from receipt through payment with intelligent matching and approval routing This AI Worker transforms AP from a paper-shuffling bottleneck into a strategic cash management function. It ingests invoices from any source—email, portal, EDI, paper—extracts data with high accuracy, matches against purchase orders and receiving documents, routes exceptions intelligently, and queues approved invoices for optimal payment timing. The worker captures early payment discounts automatically, prevents duplicate payments, and gives you real-time visibility into payables across all entities.",
