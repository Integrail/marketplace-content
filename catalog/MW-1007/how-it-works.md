# How it Works: Financial Close AI Worker

Orchestrates the entire close process and accelerates time-to-close This AI Worker transforms close from a stressful fire drill into a predictable, compressed process. It maintains the close calendar, assigns tasks to owners, tracks completion in real-time, and manages dependencies so nothing blocks progress. When tasks fall behind, it escalates automatically. The worker identifies bottlenecks, suggests process improvements, and provides leadership with accurate close status at any moment. Month-end becomes a non-event instead of an all-hands crisis.
