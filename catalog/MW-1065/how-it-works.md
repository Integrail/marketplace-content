# How it Works: Deal Qualification AI Worker

This AI Worker eliminates the gap between sales conversations and CRM data. After every call, it processes transcripts and rep notes, extracts qualification information mapped to your methodology (MEDDPIC, BANT, SPICED, or custom), and populates your CRM fields automatically. It ensures every deal has complete, consistent qualification data for accurate forecasting and deal coaching.
