# How it Works: Returns & Warranty Claims AI Worker

Automates the entire returns lifecycle from claim validation to refund processing This AI Worker transforms returns from a cost center into a customer loyalty opportunity. It validates return eligibility against your policies, determines warranty coverage, assesses damage descriptions and photos, generates RMA numbers, creates prepaid shipping labels, and tracks returns through inspection to refund. The worker reduces processing time from days to minutes while ensuring compliance with warranty terms. Customers get fast, fair resolutions; you get lower return fraud and higher post-return satisfaction.
