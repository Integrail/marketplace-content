# How it Works: Renewal Management AI Worker

Owns the complete renewal lifecycle from early engagement to closed contract This AI Worker ensures no renewal falls through the cracks—and no renewal leaves money on the table. It identifies upcoming renewals 90 days out, analyzes account health and usage patterns, generates personalized renewal proposals, and executes outreach sequences. For healthy accounts, it streamlines the process to close faster. For at-risk accounts, it alerts CSMs with specific concerns and recommended actions. The worker coordinates with legal and finance on contract processing and tracks every renewal through signature.
