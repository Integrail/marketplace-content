# How it Works: Board Reporting AI Worker

Prepares board-ready financial packages with executive summaries and supporting analysis This AI Worker ensures your board gets clear, consistent, decision-ready information every meeting. It assembles standard financial reports, generates executive summaries that highlight what matters, creates visualizations that communicate complex information simply, and formats everything to board standards. The worker handles version control, manages the review and approval workflow, and maintains a complete archive of board materials. CFOs spend their time on strategy, not PowerPoint.
