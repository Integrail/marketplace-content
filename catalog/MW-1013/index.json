  "overview": "Analyzes variances, identifies drivers, and delivers actionable explanations This AI Worker turns variance analysis from a manual investigation into instant insight delivery. It compares actuals to budget and forecast across all dimensions—entity, cost center, account, project—and automatically decomposes variances into root causes. The worker explains variances in business terms (not just accounting terms), identifies trends and anomalies, and delivers commentary that business leaders can actually use. Finance stops explaining what happened and starts advising what to do about it.",
