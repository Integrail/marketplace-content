  "overview": "Creates comprehensive investment summaries from raw data for rapid assessment This AI Worker transforms hours of analyst work into minutes of automated intelligence. It ingests raw data—financial statements, market reports, company filings, news—and produces standardized investment tearsheets that enable rapid opportunity assessment. Every tearsheet includes key metrics, competitive positioning, risk factors, and investment thesis highlights in a consistent format. Deal teams can evaluate twice as many opportunities without increasing headcount.",
