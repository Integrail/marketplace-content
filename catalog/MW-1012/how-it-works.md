# How it Works: Budget Modeling AI Worker

Facilitates annual budgeting and consolidates inputs into approved budgets This AI Worker transforms budgeting from a months-long slog into a focused, efficient process. It distributes budget templates to owners, provides prior-year data and assumptions, validates submissions for completeness and reasonableness, consolidates across all cost centers and entities, and manages the iteration cycles between business units and finance. The worker tracks        Consolidation Time approval status, generates roll-ups at any level, and produces the final board-ready budget package.
