# How it Works: Goal Setting & KPI AI Worker

Facilitates objective setting and tracks progress with company-wide alignment This AI Worker ensures every employee understands how their work connects to company success. It guides managers and employees through goal-setting conversations, suggests measurable objectives based on role and department priorities, and creates clear alignment from individual goals up to company OKRs. Throughout the cycle, it tracks progress, sends check-in reminders, and surfaces goals that are at risk—making performance management a continuous conversation rather than an annual event.
