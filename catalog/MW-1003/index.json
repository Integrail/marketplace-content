  "overview": "Forecasts cash positions and optimizes liquidity across all accounts and entities This AI Worker gives you unprecedented visibility into your cash position—today, this week, and months ahead. It aggregates balances across all bank accounts and entities, forecasts inflows from AR and scheduled receipts, projects outflows from AP and committed payments, and identifies funding gaps or surpluses before they occur. The worker recommends specific actions —accelerate collections, delay payments, draw on credit lines, invest excess cash—to optimize your liquidity position while meeting all obligations.",
