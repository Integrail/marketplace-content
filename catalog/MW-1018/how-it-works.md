# How it Works: Order Status & Shipping AI Worker

Order Status & Shipping AI Worker Delivers real-time order tracking and shipping coordination across all carriers This AI Worker eliminates "where's my order" as a support burden. It provides instant, accurate order status from any carrier, handles address changes before shipment, coordinates special delivery requirements, and generates return labels on demand. The worker accesses real-time tracking data, proactively alerts customers to delays, and resolves shipping issues before customers even know there's a problem. Your support team stops answering tracking questions and starts solving real problems.
