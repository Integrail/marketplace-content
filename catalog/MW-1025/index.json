  "overview": "Predicts at-risk accounts and recommends personalized save strategies This AI Worker catches accounts before they slip away. It goes beyond health scores to identify specific churn causes—competitor evaluation, champion departure, budget pressure, value realization failure, support frustration—and recommends targeted save strategies for each situation. The worker monitors signals that indicate active churn consideration (competitor mentions, contract review requests, executive changes) and triggers intervention playbooks while there's still time to act.",
