# How it Works: Webinar Marketing AI Worker

This AI Worker handles the complete webinar creation workflow from concept to promotion. Given a topic and speaker information, it researches the subject matter, writes a compelling script with speaker notes, designs a professional presentation deck, creates promotional content across all channels, writes email sequences for registration and follow-up, and generates post-webinar content repurposing.
