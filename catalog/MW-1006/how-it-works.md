# How it Works: Record to Report (R2R) AI Worker

Automates journal entries, reconciliations, and transaction processing continuously This AI Worker keeps your books accurate without waiting for month-end. It processes routine journal entries automatically—accruals, deferrals, allocations, reclassifications—based on business rules and source data. It performs account reconciliations continuously, investigating and clearing variances before they become problems. The worker flags unusual transactions for review, ensures proper GL coding, and gives controllers confidence that the books are always close-ready.
