  "overview": "Executes outbound payments with fraud prevention and complete audit trails This AI Worker ensures every payment goes to the right party, for the right amount, at the right time—with zero fraud losses. It validates payment details against master data, detects anomalies that suggest fraud or error, executes payments through optimal channels (ACH, wire, check, virtual card), and maintains complete audit trails for every transaction. The worker handles payment timing optimization, coordinates multi-currency payments, and ensures compliance with all payment regulations and internal controls.",
