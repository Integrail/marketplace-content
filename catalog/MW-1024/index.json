  "overview": "Assembles comprehensive quarterly business reviews in minutes, not days This AI Worker makes every QBR valuable instead of just obligatory. It aggregates usage data, support history, health trends, and ROI metrics into personalized QBR decks. Beyond the numbers, it identifies strategic talking points, surfaces expansion opportunities, and prepares discussion guides that drive meaningful conversations. CSMs spend their time on customer relationships instead of PowerPoint. Customers get QBRs that actually advance their business goals.",
